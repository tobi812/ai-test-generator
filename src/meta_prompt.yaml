      Learn yaml structure to generate code.
      The structure looks like this:
      ```yaml
      tasks:
        - language: languageName
          requirements:
            - dependency1
          instructions:
            - 'example instruction'
      ```
      Each task has the following properties:
      - Tasks are different code generation tasks.
      - Language is the language of the code to be generated.
      - Requirements are the dependencies that should be used to run the code.
      - Instructions describe what the behavior of the code should be.
